## Chime In

### 1 Create a new project

- `npx create-react-app chime-in-ui --template typescript`
- `npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @fontsource/roboto @mui/icons-material`

### 2 Implement Dark Theme using MUI and some base styling

- `createTheme` API and `ThemeProvider` for dark theme
- `CssBaseline` for base styling

### 3 Login Form

### 4 Add routing with react router dom

- `npm i react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by`
- packages: `react-router-dom`, `localforage`, `match-sorter`, `sort-by`
- react-router-dom is used for routing
- localforage is used for storing data in local storage
- match-sorter is used for sorting and filtering data
- sort-by is used for sorting data

### 5 NestJS BE setup

- install nestjs globally: `npm i -g @nestjs/cli`
- create a new nestjs project: `nest new chime-in-be`
- `pnpm run start:dev` to start the server

### 6 Setup MongoDB

- `pnpm i @nestjs/config @nestjs/mongoose mongoose`
- @nestjs/config: Configuration module for Nest
- @nestjs/mongoose: Mongoose module for Nest
- mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
- `pnpm i joi` for validation
  - will validate env variables as well
- mongodb installation: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/
- install mongo for mac: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
- create a folder data/db in ~ and from ~ run: `mongod --dbpath=data/db`
- run be: `pnpm run start:dev` and check if the connection is successful
  - mongod should log "msg":"Connection accepted"
  - be should log "MongooseCoreModule dependencies initialized"
  - if already running please kill the process.
    - `ps aux | grep mongod`
    - `kill <processid>`

### 7 Setup graphql and apollo, users resources

- `pnpm i @nestjs/graphql @nestjs/apollo @apollo/server graphql`
- graphql playground: http://localhost:3000/graphql
- `nest g resource users`

### 8 Abstract Schema and Abstract Repository

- abstract schema for common fields
- abstract repository for common methods

### 9 User CRUD, User Entity and User Repository, Refactor Abstract entity, Abstract repository

### 10 User CRUD continued

- `pnpm i bcrypt` and `pnpm i -D @types/bcrypt`
- sample graphql queries and mutations:
- createUser:

```
mutation {
  createUser(createUserInput:{
    email:"user1@kirandash.com",
    password: "password123"
  }) {
    _id
    email
  }
}
```

### 11 MongoDB compass

- https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass

### 12 Add logging with pino logger

- https://github.com/pinojs/pino
- Docs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-pino
- `pnpm i nestjs-pino pino-http pino-pretty`

### 13 Modify logging config for production

### 14 DB Migrations - up and down

- we will use https://www.npmjs.com/package/migrate-mongo
- `pnpm i migrate-mongo`
- type: `pnpm i -D @types/migrate-mongo`
- `pnpm i mongodb`: to get access to the types
- create migration for user email index and make it unique
- we can use this for validation to make sure we don't have duplicate emails
- in mongo client we should be able to see `email_1` index
- and in changelog we should see the migration file details

### 15 UI - Apollo Client Setup

- apollo client is a graphql client that helps us to interact with the graphql server from the client side i.e. our react app
- it will help us manage data both local and remote
- it will help us fetch, cache and modify data
- we need to write query and mutation on UI using graphql with apollo client
- `pnpm i @apollo/client graphql` from ui folder

### 16 Create User from UI

- install apollo client devtools extension (ext id: apollographql.vscode-apollo)
- to fix CORS issue:
  - use proxy in package.json: `"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"`. this will proxy all requests to 3000

### 17 Backend Authentication with Passport

- `pnpm install --save @nestjs/passport passport passport-local`
- `pnpm install --save-dev @types/passport-local`
- https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/passport
- https://www.passportjs.org/packages/
- we are using passport-local strategy for now
  - it will accept a username and password and authenticate the user and return a jwt token
- generate auth module: `nest g module auth`
- generate auth service: `nest g service auth`

### 18 Local Auth guard using Passport Local Strategy and custom user decorator

- Expose local strategy as a guard
- https://docs.nestjs.com/guards#authorization-guard
- `nest g controller auth`
- read more about custom decorators: https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/other-features#custom-decorators

### 19 JWT functionality

- https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/passport#jwt-functionality
- `pnpm install --save @nestjs/jwt passport-jwt`
- `pnpm install --save-dev @types/passport-jwt`
- generate secret key: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
- you can decode jwt token at https://jwt.io/
- send jwt token back in reponse

### 20 JWT Strategy and apply the jwt auth guards

- use jwt strategy to authenticate jwt and apply to graphql, REST endpoints
- `pnpm i cookie-parser`: to parse cookies from request and attach to response
- `pnpm i -D @types/cookie-parser`
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser
- use cookie parser to parse cookies from request and attach to response
- use jwt strategy to authenticate jwt and apply to graphql, REST endpoints

### 21 Login from UI with useLogin hook

- create useLogin.ts hook

### 22 Error handling for sign-in and sign-up

### 23 Home page and AuthGuard

### 24 Redirect Implementation - for unauthenticated users

- if user is not signed in, redirect to sign in page
  - let's do this by checking the status code, if it is 401, redirect to sign in page
- also if jwt token is expired, backend will return 401
- TODO ðŸš¨: Currently unauthenticated errors from apollo are uncaught and we need to fix this. This happens during logout

### 24 Redirect onSuccesful login

- after successful login, redirect to home page

### 25 Login after signup programmatically

### 26 Header - AppBar

- https://mui.com/material-ui/react-app-bar/

### 27 Logout - BE and FE

### 28 Hide user settings icon from header if not logged in

### 29 More Error handling on UI with Alert and Snackbar

- TODO: ðŸš¨ Navigation not working on clicking the links

### 30 Chat List UI using MUI List

- https://mui.com/material-ui/react-list/#align-list-items

### 31 New Chat Modal

### 32 BE for Create Chat

- create chat resource
  - `nest g resource chats`
- for validation: https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation#using-the-built-in-validationpipe
- `pnpm i --save class-validator class-transformer`

### 33 GraphQL Type Generation

- install on ui code base
- https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started/installation
- `npm i -D @graphql-codegen/cli @parcel/watcher`
  - graphql codegen will generate types for us
  - parcel watcher will watch for changes and regenerate types
- `npx graphql-code-generator init`
- run watch script parallely using https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently
- `npm i -D concurrently`

### 34 Create Chat from UI

### 35 BE for Chat List

- we created a findAll method in chat service
- on FE we created useFindChats to call the graphql query
- we also created a chat.fragment.ts to define the fields we need from the chat object

### 36 Update chat list query on chat creation

- after chat creation, update the cache with the new chat (useCreateChat hook)
- also make sure to export the chat fragment from chat.fragment.ts
- add error handling

### 37 Chat details page - Backend - findOne and Frontend

### 38 Create Message backend and frontend

- each chat will have multiple messages
  - one to many relationship
- `nest g resource chats/messages`
  - this will generate all the stub files
- https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/circular-dependency

### 39 Get Messages for a chat room and update cache after message creation

- to update the cache for particular chatId, use readQuery and writeQuery

### 40 Some UI improvements

- TODO: ðŸš¨ Check why content IsNotEmpty validaiton not working for createMessage

### 41 Websockets using GraphQL Subscriptions ðŸŒŸ - Config

- To receive real-time updates from the server, we will use GraphQL Subscriptions.
  - why websockets?
    - we can use polling but it is not efficient
    - websockets are more efficient
- on BE:
  - `pnpm i graphql-ws graphql-subscriptions`
  - https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws
    - this will help us to create a websocket server using graphql
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-subscriptions
    - this will help us establish pub sub functionality
- Implement pub sub functionality
  - implement locally at first and make it persistent later
